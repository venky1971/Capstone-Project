## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)

Mydata <- read.csv("ZHVI_IRSI.csv")

ggplot(Mydata, aes(x = Adjusted_Gross_Income/1000000, y = Zillow_Home_Value_Index/1000000)) +
      geom_point() +
      scale_x_continuous(name = "Annual Gross Income in millions", limits = c(0, 12)) + 
      scale_y_continuous(name = "Zillow Home Value Index in millions", limits = c(0, 7))
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
